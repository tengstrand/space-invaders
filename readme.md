<h1>Development assignment</h1>

Space invaders are upon us!
You were shortlisted as one of the great minds to help us track them down.

Your Clojure application must take a radar sample as an argument and reveal possible locations of those pesky invaders.
Good luck!

### Requirements:
- No image detection, this is all about ASCII patterns
- This is a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your understanding of Immutability, Function Composition, State Management in a functional language as well as Code reusability and Higher-order Functions.
- Fully tested code with unit tests.
- Ideally use atomic commit history, so we can see the progression.

### Tips:
- The noise in the radar can be either false positives or false negatives
- Think of edge cases ... pun intended ;)
